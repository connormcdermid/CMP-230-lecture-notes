## Components of Computer Architecture
	
	- Central Processing Unit (CPU)  
		Typically contains:  
		- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), performs arithmetic and logical relationships  
		- Control Unit (CU) extracts enstructions from real memory, decodes, and executes  
			Decoding and validating the bit strings consumes the greatest portion  
			of clock cycles used by CPU  
  
	- Registers
		Special, high-speed storage areas packaged with CPU
		16 registers, 64 bits across
		Hold either memory address or signed numeric value
		Extremely fast, extremely near the CPU
	- Program Status Word (PSW) or Program Control Register (PC)
		Special hardware register -- contains information about the current state of processing
		Contains the information required for proper program execution, such as:
			-- error statis field
			-- condition code set by prior instruction
			-- interrupt enable/disable masking bit
			-- supervisor/problem state mode bit
		In General, the PSW is used to control instruction sequencing.
		The active or controlling PSW is the **CURRENT PSW**. THe current PSW is represented by a hardware register.
		There are other PSW(s) located in fixed positions in real memory, one OLD PSW and one NEW PSW for each possible type of interruption. These PSWs are swapped into/from the CURRENT PSW upon a particular interruption event
		State Mode bit: whether or not the system is running in priveleged mode or not
		If an exception occurs, it will be thrown up to the OS, which will then throw it up to the proper level at which it will be dealt with

	- Word length and Data Alignment
		8 bits = 1 byte
		1 word = 4 bytes aligned on a byte boundary whose address is divisible by 4
		A half-word = half the length of a word, aligned on a byte boundary divisible by 2
		Double-word = twice the length of a word -- aligned on a byte boundary divisible by 8
		An architectural even byte boundary is any location divisible by 2 (2, 4, 6, 8)
		Save for bit location ZERO, bit locations of 1-7 are not checked for instructions or data (for simplicity reasons)
		Since all data other than single bits must begin on a byte boundary, the CPU can therefore ignore most bit locations
		Should instructions begin on an odd boundary, the CPU must perform extra work
		
	- Addressability
		Each individually accessible nyte of info in storage is selected using its numerical memory address (location)
		In modern computers, location-addressable storage is limited to the range of real storage
		The ability to reach a particular location in memory is limited by the numerical range that can be accommodated by a register
		the greater the addressability, the more information that can be fit into sufficiently larger real memory
	- Fixed storage locations
		Areas in the computer memory that the hardware will place status information regarding internal and external exceptions -- cause storing and loading of PSWs when an interruption occurs
		The first 4096 bytes of ream memory are the Prefixed Storage Area or Page Zero.
		OS manufacturers must always adhere to this interface so the hardware can correctly communicate with the OS. The owner of Page Zero is recognised by the hardware as the other of the computer, and the only software that can run privileged instructions

	- Instruction set
		Comprises the operations that are the smallest programmed unites that the CPU can interpret as the functional guidelines to accomplish some operation or manipulative task.
		Anything lower than this is electrical engineering -- AKA, *not your job*.
		Each instruction is a provably reliable function or procedure carried out by the hardware.

## Interruption Handling
	- When an application is running, the OS is *idle*
	- When an application has an error, the CPU causes an exception -- this triggers the hardware interruption circuitry
	- PSW is copied down to the OLD PSW in Fixed Storage
	- NEW PSW is copied up to the CURRENT PSW.
	- CPU is stopped during PSW swap
	- NEW PSW contains the location of the PGM Interrupt Handler as defined by OS manuacturer -- this is how the OS regains control
	- EXT interrupt handler is for CPU-CPU communications
	- I/O interrupt handler is for input/output operations
	- SVC interrupt is for privileged interrupts -- normal operation
	- Interrupt handlers are the only points of entry to the OS
	- 4 interrupt handlers discussed here are the most common -- there are actually 6, we will not talk about final 2
	- When not handling an interrupt, OS is *idle*

# Program performance measures and factors
	- CPU Time
		System consumption of the CPU (overhead)
		User application use of CPU time
	- Wall Clock TIme
		Measure of elapsed real time
	- I/O Execution time vs. CPU Execution time
		Time durations for moving data from place to place (I/O operations)
		Time spend consuming CPU cycles in computation (add, multiply, bit-shift, etc.)	

	- Architectural ways to improve performance
		More, better, faster hardware
		Reduce thermal energy loss
		Optimise algorithm to use less instructions
		Optimise algorithm to use faster instructions
		Reduce instruction set size	
		Run instructions in parallel
		Provide a CPU Cache
		Remove bottlenecks occuring with CPU speed, memory availability, or I/O traffic
