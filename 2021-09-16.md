## Components of Computer Architecture
	
	- Central Processing Unit (CPU)  
		Typically contains:  
		- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), performs arithmetic and logical relationships  
		- Control Unit (CU) extracts enstructions from real memory, decodes, and executes  
			Decoding and validating the bit strings consumes the greatest portion  
			of clock cycles used by CPU  
  
	- Registers
		Special, high-speed storage areas packaged with CPU
		16 registers, 64 bits across
		Hold either memory address or signed numeric value
		Extremely fast, extremely near the CPU
	- Program Status Word (PSW) or Program Control Register (PC)
		Special hardware register -- contains information about the current state of processing
		Contains the information required for proper program execution, such as:
			-- error statis field
			-- condition code set by prior instruction
			-- interrupt enable/disable masking bit
			-- supervisor/problem state mode bit
		In General, the PSW is used to control instruction sequencing.
		The active or controlling PSW is the **CURRENT PSW**. THe current PSW is represented by a hardware register.
		There are other PSW(s) located in fixed positions in real memory, one OLD PSW and one NEW PSW for each possible type of interruption. These PSWs are swapped into/from the CURRENT PSW upon a particular interruption event
		State Mode bit: whether or not the system is running in priveleged mode or not
